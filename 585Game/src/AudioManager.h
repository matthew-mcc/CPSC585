// What kind of behaviour do we want?
// First, initialize audio engine
// We want it to keep all of our sound GUID
// We also want some parameters that can be passed around. Other systems should be able to manipulate those parameters
// Do we need 2 classes for this?
// One that manages which sounds to play and one that other classes can pass parameters around?
